## Overview

![Simple Article Listing Screenshot](https://github.com/name/simple-article-listing/raw/main/resources/design/Screenshot.jpg)

This project is a clean and simple webpage that displays a list of articles related to technology. It includes a header section with an introductory heading, followed by a series of articles. Each article features an image, a title, and a publication date. The layout is responsive, adapting from a vertical layout on smaller screens to a horizontal layout on larger screens.

## What I learned

- **Responsive Layout**: I learned how to implement a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The articles shift from a column layout to a row layout on wider screens, ensuring the design remains user-friendly across devices.
- **CSS Variables**: I used CSS custom properties (variables) to manage the color scheme and font sizes, making the design easier to adjust and maintain.
- **Flexbox for Layout**: Flexbox was used to align the content and control the layout. This helped me understand how to easily align items and manage spacing in a flexible manner.
- **Image Handling**: I learned how to use the `srcset` attribute to serve different image resolutions based on the screen size, improving performance for users with high-resolution displays.
- **Typography with Google Fonts**: I utilized the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts to create a modern and clean typographic style for the article headings and body text.
